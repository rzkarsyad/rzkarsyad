### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Rizki Muhammad Aulia Arsyad**.\
I am an enthusiastic student with **WordPress Development**, **UI/UX design**, and **Android Programming**.
During this time I have also been a freelancer working on video editing and flyer design projects.

I'm also currently working on my personal project using WordPress.

I also create UI/UX designs and I upload them to
[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/rzkarsyad).

If you are interested in getting to know me, please follow my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rzkarsyad/) account.
